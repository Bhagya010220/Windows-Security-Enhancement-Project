# Windows-Security-Enhancement-Project
Implementing CIS Benchmarks and SNORT Integration
I actively contributed to the development of the 'Windows Security Enhancement Tool' as a team member in a cybersecurity project. This Python-based tool was designed to enhance the security of Windows 10 systems at Company XYZ, aligning with Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks and incorporating SNORT for intrusion detection. My role involved creating a user-friendly interface for executing password and firewall security commands, implementing CIS benchmarks, conducting system testing to validate security controls and attack simulations, and crafting custom SNORT rules for intrusion detection. I played a part in all project phases, from initial planning to deployment and continuous monitoring. This project underscores my practical skills in cybersecurity, Python programming, and security tool utilization, making me a well-qualified candidate for cybersecurity roles
